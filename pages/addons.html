    <h2>Netting</h2>
    <p>Netting can be ordered to specific dimensions, and comes with a separate
        frame, which is then attached to the frame of a window. </p>
    <p>Window netting can be: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>fixed</li>
        <li>sliding sideways</li>
        <li>sliding upwards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Door netting can be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>swinging</li>
        <li>sliding sideways</li>
        <li>sliding upwards</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Window boards, fascias, reveal liner</h2>
    <p>
        uPVC window boards, fascias, and reveal liners play crucial roles in enhancing the aesthetics and 
        functionality of windows and doors. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Window boards provide a neat and durable surface beneath windows, protecting against moisture 
        and offering a finishing touch to interior spaces. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Fascias are essential for covering and protecting the edges of roofs and external walls, 
        ensuring a clean and uniform appearance to the building's exterior. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Reveal liners, on the other hand, help to conceal the rough openings around windows and doors, 
        creating a smooth transition between the frame and the wall. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Made from high-quality uPVC, these components are known for their low maintenance requirements, 
        weather resistance, and longevity, making them popular choices for both residential and 
        commercial applications.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Trims, soffits, architraves</h2>
    <p>
        uPVC trims, soffits, and architraves are essential components that add both aesthetic appeal and 
        functionality to building exteriors and interiors. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Trims serve as protective barriers, covering the gaps and joints where different building 
        materials meet, ensuring a clean and finished look. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Soffits are installed beneath the roof overhangs, providing ventilation and protecting the 
        underlying structures from moisture and pests. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Architraves, on the other hand, frame doorways and windows, enhancing the architectural detail 
        and overall design of interior spaces.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Crafted from high-quality uPVC, these components offer excellent durability, weather 
        resistance, and low maintenance requirements. 
    </p>
    <p>
        They are available in a variety of styles, colors, and finishes, allowing for customization 
        to match any architectural style or design preference. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With their combination of practicality and aesthetic versatility, uPVC trims, soffits, and 
        architraves are popular choices for both new construction and renovation projects.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Roller blinds, venetian blinds</h2>
    <p>uPVC roller blinds and Venetian blinds are popular window treatments that offer both practicality 
        and style. Roller blinds are sleek and versatile, providing a simple yet effective way to 
        control light and privacy in any room. Their smooth operation and low-profile design make them 
        ideal for modern interiors. Venetian blinds, on the other hand, feature horizontal slats that 
        can be tilted to control the amount of light entering a room, offering a timeless and elegant 
        look.</p>

    <p>Both types of blinds are often made with uPVC components, ensuring durability, moisture 
        resistance, and ease of maintenance. uPVC blinds are available in a wide range of colors, 
        textures, and finishes, allowing homeowners to customize their window treatments to match their 
        d√©cor and personal preferences. Whether you prefer the streamlined simplicity of roller blinds 
        or the classic charm of Venetian blinds, uPVC options offer a reliable and stylish solution for 
        enhancing your windows.</p>
        
    <p>Blinds can be remote controled and manual.</p>

        <h2>Glass</h2>
        <p>Glass for uPVC windows plays a pivotal role in determining the overall performance, energy 
            efficiency, and aesthetic appeal of the window system. High-quality glass options, such as 
            double or triple glazing, are commonly used to enhance thermal insulation, reducing heat 
            loss during colder months and minimizing heat gain in warmer seasons. This not only improves
             the comfort level inside the home but also contributes to significant energy savings by 
             reducing the reliance on heating and cooling systems.</p>

             features, sound insulation, and UV protection, depending on the specific needs and
              preferences of the homeowner. With advancements in glass technology, there are now various
               types of coatings and treatments available that can further improve the performance and
                longevity of the glass, making it more resistant to scratches, condensation, and
                 environmental factors.</p>
        <p>When choosing glass for uPVC windows, it's essential to consider factors such as location,
             climate, and desired performance characteristics to select the most suitable option. With
              a wide range of choices available, including tinted, frosted, and decorative glass, 
              homeowners can customize their uPVC windows to achieve both functional benefits and
